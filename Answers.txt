Why the app cant start:
error:

System.AggregateException: 'Some services are not able to be constructed (Error while validating the service descriptor 'ServiceType: MovieRental.Rental.IRentalFeatures Lifetime: Singleton ImplementationType: MovieRental.Rental.RentalFeatures': Cannot consume scoped service 'MovieRental.Data.MovieRentalDbContext' from singleton 'MovieRental.Rental.IRentalFeatures'.)'
answer:
The app fails to start because MovieRentalDbContext is registered as a scoped service, but RentalFeatures was registered as a singleton and depends on it.

You cannot inject a scoped service into a singleton, because scoped services are created per request, while singletons are created only once for the application's lifetime.

To fix this, we changed the registration of RentalFeatures to scoped, matching the lifetime of MovieRentalDbContext. After this change, the app starts successfully.
